# üìã Resume Bullets - Nature Chat Application

## üöÄ **Full-Stack Real-Time Chat Application | React, Flask, MongoDB, AWS**
*October 2025*

### **Primary Bullet (Most Important)**
- Developed secure real-time messaging platform using **React 18**, **Flask 3.0**, **Socket.IO**, and **MongoDB**, supporting instant messaging, friend requests, and online status tracking with WebSocket connections

---

## üîí **Production AWS Deployment & Security**
- Deployed production environment on **AWS EC2** with comprehensive security hardening including **SSH key-based authentication**, **UFW firewall**, **fail2ban intrusion prevention**, and **Nginx reverse proxy** with SSL/TLS encryption

---

## üê≥ **DevOps & Infrastructure Management**
- Implemented **Docker containerization** for MongoDB database, **systemd service management** for auto-restart capabilities, and **Let's Encrypt SSL certificates** with automatic renewal for HTTPS traffic encryption

---

## üõ°Ô∏è **Security Implementation & Hardening**
- Architected **defense-in-depth security** strategy including custom SSH port (2222), rate limiting (10 req/sec), security headers (XSS/clickjacking protection), and MongoDB authentication with bcrypt password hashing

---

## ‚ö° **Real-Time Features & Database Design**
- Built scalable database schema with MongoDB collections for users, messages, and contacts, implementing **real-time features** using Socket.IO for instant message delivery and friend request notifications

---

## üìä **Production Monitoring & Maintenance**
- Configured **comprehensive logging** with systemd journalctl, **log rotation** to prevent disk overflow, and **fail2ban monitoring** with automated IP blocking for brute-force attack prevention

---

## üé® **Additional Technical Achievements**

### **Frontend Development**
- Created responsive **React SPA** with glass-morphism UI design, animated nature backgrounds, and real-time state management using Context API

### **Backend API Design**
- Designed **RESTful API** with 15+ endpoints for authentication, user management, friend requests, and message handling with comprehensive error handling

### **Database Architecture**
- Implemented **MongoDB NoSQL database** with optimized indexes, relationship management for contacts/friends, and efficient message storage with pagination

### **Real-Time Communication**
- Integrated **WebSocket technology** using Socket.IO for bidirectional real-time communication, online status tracking, and instant message delivery

### **Production Deployment**
- Successfully deployed **24/7 production application** accessible at [https://chatroom.serveblog.net](https://chatroom.serveblog.net) with automatic failover and monitoring

---

## üèÜ **Key Technologies Demonstrated**

### **Frontend**
- React 18, JavaScript ES6+, CSS3 (Glass-morphism, Animations), Vite, Axios

### **Backend**
- Python, Flask 3.0, Flask-SocketIO, Flask-Login, bcrypt, PyMongo, python-dotenv

### **Database**
- MongoDB, NoSQL, Database Indexing, Relationship Management

### **DevOps & Infrastructure**
